### Mailbox Security System

Mailbox security system helps you capture the photo of a person who opened your mailbox.

The moment anyone opens the mailbox, the magnatic switch (attached inside the mailbox) triggers an event which is listened by microcontroller - Tessel2. Tessel2 then starts capturing photos via attached USB cameras and uploads the same on Google Drive. Once upload is finished, it sends a notification on mobile with the link to the uploaded image.
